## To Use:
Phase 1 and 2 extract and compile the database. Phase 3 is the interface.

To use Phase 3:

1. Install Python 3 (any version should work)
2. Ensure you have the "bsddb3" dependency. Use 
````
pip install bsddb3
````
3. Use the command:
````
python phase3.py
````

Use the predefined index files in the "Index_Files" directory. 

That may or may not work. Recommended to use a linux OS for this.
